## Agilex Book Club

----

This book club is intended to give developers in the Virginia area, mainly those
who work at [Agilex Technologies](http://www.agilex.com), a place to continue
their developers skills. Whether it be development or learning new processes, we
intend for this to be an experience that won't take up much time, rather have
each developer to learn more than they would while in the work environment.  

We are currently meeting at the (Starbucks in Gainesville,
VA)[http://www.starbucks.com/store/14670/us/gainesville/7375-atlas-walk-way-bldg-g-gainesville-va],
each Saturday at 1:00 PM. These meetings are time blocked to be no longer than 2
hours long, and will be a chance for developers to discuss what they learned
from the current book we are reading from. Here is the outline of how we are
currently planning to work with each book:  

1. We pick a book that we will focus on  
2. From that book we will plan how we will schedule the reading of the book  
3. No book will go longer than a month. If it does, we will break apart the book
for separate reading plans.  
4. Each week a developer will be asked to take as much time as they can set
aside to devote towards the reading plan for that week. Not only will developers
read the book, they will also create coding use cases for the reading, that will
be put into a branch of this repository. 
5. Each Saturday that we meet, we will review the code that each developer has
pushed to the repository for code review. This will give all that are
participating a chance to learn from each other. There will be no code reviews
that are geared towards evaluating a developers skills, rather only give advice
that other developers can give that will be of help.
6. During the first week of the month, the developers will come up with a
project that will create an application of some type that revolves around the
programming language we are learning. 
7. In the case that we get more than 6 developers that are attending, we will
separate the developers into teams for projects. This will allow the developers
to work together in smaller teams rather than 1 large team.
