[Proposed Learning Plan](#proposed-learning-plan)  

### Overview  
This book club is intended to give developers in the Virginia area, mainly those
who work at [NoVa Technologies](http://www.agilex.com), a place to continue
their developers skills. Whether it be development or learning new processes, we
intend for this to be an experience that won't take up much time, rather have
each developer to learn more than they would while in the work environment.  

We are currently meeting at the [Starbucks in Gainesville,
VA](http://www.starbucks.com/store/14670/us/gainesville/7375-atlas-walk-way-bldg-g-gainesville-va),
each Saturday at 1:00 PM. These meetings are time blocked to be no longer than 2
hours long, and will be a chance for developers to discuss what they learned
from the current book we are reading from. Here is the outline of how we are
currently planning to work with each book:  

1. We pick a book that we will focus on  
2. From that book we will plan how we will schedule the reading of the book  
3. No book will go longer than a month. If it does, we will break apart the book
for separate reading plans.  
  4. Each week a developer will be asked to take as much time as they can set
  aside to devote towards the reading plan for that week. Not only will developers
  read the book, they will also create coding use cases for the reading, that will
  be put into a branch of this repository. 
  5. Each Saturday that we meet, we will review the code that each developer has
  pushed to the repository for code review. This will give all that are
  participating a chance to learn from each other. There will be no code reviews
  that are geared towards evaluating a developers skills, rather only give advice
  that other developers can give that will be of help.
  6. During the first week of the month, the developers will come up with a
  project that will create an application of some type that revolves around the
  programming language we are learning. 
  7. In the case that we get more than 6 developers that are attending, we will
  separate the developers into teams for projects. This will allow the developers
  to work together in smaller teams rather than 1 large team.

### Proposed Learning Plan  

Our first book that we will be working from is [Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks). The
book is broken apart for seven weeks, but we are going to do seven months. This
will give us time to understand more about each of the languages.  

#### Month One  

##### Ruby  

1. *Week 1: History and basic of Ruby* 
  1. During the week each developer will think of the project that will be done by the end of the month from the learning of the basics of Ruby.
  2. Each developer will create a branch on this repo that will use the naming convention: {club-username}/ruby-{week1} - for example: rsimpson/ruby-week1  
  3. The developer will create markdown files in the branch will any information learned from the week that can be shared with others  
  4. If there is any use cases of code that you would like to do, please do so in the branch using a folder for that use case that can be shared
2. *Week 2: Ruby in the Console*  
  1. Learn to use Ruby in the console using `irb`. The book is pretty simple with the code samples, so it will be up to the developers to go beyond what is learned in this part of the book and possible create small programs that will run inside of `irb`.
  2. This will use the same naming conventions aboved for each developers branch.  
3. *Week 3: functions, classes, mixins, modules* 
  1. Learn the foundations of Ruby while starting to create Ruby programs that run from files that you create.
4. *Week 4: Metaprogramming* 
  1. Learn ways a language looks and works 
  2. Write a program that writes a program. This will be the project that was defined in week 1.
